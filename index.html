	<p style="text-align:justify;"> My name is Maria and I come from a place full of magic realism called Colombia. 
			Since the year 2015, I moved out across the continent to study my Master in Switzerland and since then that is what I have been doing so far.
			I also work as an Academic &amp; Marketing assistant at the Geneva School of Diplomacy which has allowed me to explore a little bit my creative side.
			In fact, recently I discovered that I love photography, and so, my second page is a visual journey of a part of my life.
			
	</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">	I also love literature and for a while I even study a major of it, but I never really finished it though. I don't have a favourite writer but
			I tend to read Murakami a lot, perhaps because of the mistery, or the cats, or the frontier between the real and the fiction of his novels that I
			enjoy. I also like Milan Kundera and Banana Yoshimoto very much. 
			
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another passion I have is the cinema, I have to at least watch one movie per day. I have watched everything in the world, from independent movies to
			really cheesy hollywood movies. The limit does not exist. And although I have liked many films, I wouldn't dare for a minute to choose one as my 
			favourite, it's impossible with so many chefs-d'oeuvre out there. 
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;"> Finally, thank you for reading all of my rambling. Don't hesitate to check my experimental photo project in the second page.
			Enjoy!
